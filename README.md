Hello, my name is Daniel and I am currently a junior in highschool.

In game development I would like to someday create my own games in the 
future and be able to work with a team that will help me improve and 
create these games

Currently I am not working on any projects but I am learning some 
programming languages such as C#, java, and javascript and plan to 
learn more in the future
